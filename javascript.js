// My plan is to write out my thought process behind 
// writing script for the rockPaperScissors game. 

// i will need a prompt or an input asking the user to
// select either rock paper or scissors. 

// the computer will then need to spit out its own random choice. 

// establish a winner and let them know who it is.
